rock-paper-scissors in javascript

This is a console only version of rock-paper-scissors, you need to have the console open to play!

You can either a) open the html file on your browser, press "cancel" on the input window, open the console and then type " console.log(game()) " or b) you can just close the input window, open the console and reload the page.
